Time complexity:
The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string s. This is because we iterate through the string once to filter and normalize the characters, and then we perform a comparison which also takes linear time.

Space complexity:

The space complexity is O(n), as we use additional space to store the filtered and normalized version of the string a, which in the worst case could be as long as the original string s.
